# AuthAnvil Export Viewer
All on-prem AuthAnvil servers will be rendered unusable December of 2023 when Kaseya/Scorpion software shut down their licensing server.
This is an XSLT that translates a "total export" from Auth Anvil to viewable/usable HTML.

This is *not* a replacment for a proper password vault application.  It has no security of any kind, it has no concept of users or access control, it cannot modify anything; it is simply a way to visualize an export file in a familiar way.

This project is not sponsored by Kaseya or Scorpion Software or anyone else.  The author is not now and has never been an employee of Kaseya or any of its related companies.
